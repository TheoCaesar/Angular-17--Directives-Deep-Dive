# Directives
These are simply ways to enhance the abilities of elements - be it their attributes, props or features. 
Components are basically directives with templates.
There are 2 types of directives - structural (ngIf & ngFor) and attributes (ngModel).
Structural directives change the DOM structure and are preceded with an asterisks. Current versions of angular dont have structural directives any more.
